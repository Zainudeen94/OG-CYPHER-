        <h3>My Story - <a href="/zainu.html">Zainudeen</a>
    </center>
    </h3>
    <hr>
    <p>I am Zainudeen, a certified Computer Engier, Micrisoft Server Admininistrator, Network specialist and an aspiring
        developer. I'm the founder of <a href="/deentech.html"> Deentech IT Solutions.</a></p>

    <p>I started my journey like many others--full of ambition, facing real-life struggles, and trying to find my place
        in a noisy world. I grew up in Ghana and attended <a href="/shs.html">Ngleshie Amanfro Senior High</a> before
        pursuing IT certifications from City and Guilds of London. I'm currently furthering my studies at AIT
        Univeristy, and even on days when I have just three hours of class, I don't sit idle-- I go out and work.
    </p>
    <p>When I'm not in the classroom or working on tech solutions, I split my time between the Kasoa <a
            href="/timber.html">Timber Market</a> and Ampotech, where I put my hands to work to earn a living and
        support my vision. Whether it's lifting timber or suppporting operational tasks at Ampotech, I believe in
        staying productive, grounded, and relentless in pursuit of my goals.</p>

    <p>Yes, even as a certified IT professional, I do what it takes to make end meet-because survival comes before
        pride, and discipline fuels dreams.</p>
    <p>From working at Lucky TV Ghana managing WordPress sites and social media, I have always believed that knowledge
        means nothing without action. My days may start with networks and end with lifting wood, but it's all part of
        the
        journey.</p>

    <p>Today, I help clients solve IT problems, build better systems, and move forward with confidence. Behind every
        solution I provide is a story of resilence, realness, and relentless pursuit of excellence.</p>
